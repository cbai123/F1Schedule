# F1 Schedule

A simple website to provide easy access to the schedule of the Formula 1 season. Shows dates of races; and start times for qualifying, sprint races, and races. The website also highlights the next scheduled race.

## How to use F1 Schedule

## Reasons for the website
It is useful to me to be able to see the time across a Formula 1 weekend that qualifying, sprints, and races start. The official F1 website contains this information, however, to access my local start time requires too many clicks. It may be my laziness but it frustrates me that the default time on the schedule page is track time not local. On a google search it will give you the local start time but only of the race, there is no info on qualifying and sprints. This website allows easy access to all start times across every weekend in your local time. And, highlights which race is next and on what date.


## Tech Stack

For this project I am using:


- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing.
- [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) for race information.
